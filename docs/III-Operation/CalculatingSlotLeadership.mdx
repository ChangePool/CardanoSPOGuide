## Log Entries Related to Block Production

In the Cardano Node log for the block-producing node in your stake pool configuration, the `Forge.Loop.NodeNotLeader` trace adds an entry for every slot when your stake pool is NOT elected to prepare a block. For example:

```
[cardanonode:Forge.Loop.NodeNotLeader](Info,94) Not leading slot 91529678
```

In a slot when your stake pool is elected to prepare a block, the log for the block producer includes timestamped entries that the `Forge.loop.NodeIsLeader` and `Forge.Loop.AdoptedBlock` traces add. For example:

```
[cardanonode:Forge.Loop.NodeIsLeader](Info,94) Leading slot 91529679
[cardanonode:Forge.Loop.AdoptedBlock](Info,94) Adopted block forged in slot 91529679: 081d7bd9bab008f9ac94223ea25bf1b75d4a79f7c222f81b74e72a282e9a6ceb
```

<!-- October 1, 2025 - The sample log entries are taken from an instance of Cardano Node operating in the Preview Testnet environment. -->

The `Forge.Loop.NodeIsLeader` log entry indicates that the local Cardano Node instance is preparing a block for the specified slot.

The `Forge.Loop.AdoptedBlock` log entry indicates that the Cardano network accepted the block that your stake pool prepared and submitted. Rarely, the network may need to reject a block after accepting the block. To confirm that a block your stake pool prepares is added to the Cardano blockchain ledger successfully, search for the block hash included in the `Forge.Loop.AdoptedBlock` log entry using a Cardano [blockchain explorer](https://explorer.cardano.org/).
