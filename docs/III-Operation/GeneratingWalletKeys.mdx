Cardano uses numerous cryptographic key pairs to secure your wallet and stake pool. A key pair is comprised of a public verification key file having the `.vkey` file name extension and a secret key file having the `.skey` extension. You use key pairs to generate addresses and certificates securely.

To operate a stake pool, you need to create the following addresses for a wallet:

- **Payment Address**—Used to store, receive and send money
- **Stake Address**—Used to store and withdraw rewards, as well as to define the stake pool owner, reward accounts and stake pool delegation
