      <h1>Log Entries Related to Block Production</h1>

      <p>When <a href="/StartingNodes#Monitoring-the-Cardano-Node-Log">Monitoring the Cardano Node Log</a> for the block producer in your stake pool configuration, the <code>Forge.Loop.NodeNotLeader</code> trace adds an entry for every slot when a stake pool is NOT elected to prepare a block. For example:</p>

      <CodeBlock>
        {`[cardanonode:Forge.Loop.NodeNotLeader](Info,94) Not leading slot 91529678`}
      </CodeBlock>

      <p>In a slot when the stake pool that you operate is elected to prepare a block, the log for the block producer includes timestamped entries that the <code>Forge.loop.NodeIsLeader</code> and <code>Forge.Loop.AdoptedBlock</code> traces add. For example:</p>

      <CodeBlock>
        {`[cardanonode:Forge.Loop.NodeIsLeader](Info,94) Leading slot 91529679
[cardanonode:Forge.Loop.AdoptedBlock](Info,94) Adopted block forged in slot 91529679: 081d7bd9bab008f9ac94223ea25bf1b75d4a79f7c222f81b74e72a282e9a6ceb`}
      </CodeBlock>

      {/* <!-- October 1, 2025 - The sample log entries are taken from an instance of Cardano Node operating in the Preview Testnet environment. --> */}

      <p>The <code>Forge.Loop.NodeIsLeader</code> log entry indicates that the local Cardano Node instance is preparing a block for the specified slot.</p>

      <p>The <code>Forge.Loop.AdoptedBlock</code> log entry indicates that the Cardano network accepted the block that the stake pool prepared and submitted. Rarely, the network may need to reject a block after accepting the block. To confirm that a block the stake pool you operate prepares is added to the Cardano blockchain ledger successfully, search for the block hash included in the <code>Forge.Loop.AdoptedBlock</code> log entry or the stake pool ID using a Cardano <a href="https://explorer.cardano.org/" target="_blank">blockchain explorer</a>.</p>
