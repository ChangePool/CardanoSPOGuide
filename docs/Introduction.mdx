      <p>Operating a Cardano stake pool is similar to owning a bank. By design, the minimum cost involved in setting up a stake pool is low. Stake pools help to secure an ecosystem having the potential to continue growing on a global scale, without limits set by geopolitics.</p>

      <p>Operating a stake pool is a means to an end—not an end in itself—giving you a unique opportunity to grow a resilient community of shared values, no matter where you are, who you are or what you do. When starting a stake pool, you do not need to know everything about how you plan to succeed. Day to day, you operate a stake pool on your own terms. Do not seek permission. You do not need to explain your reasons for being a stake pool operator to anyone. No one can stop you. For example, you cannot be "banned" from operating a Cardano stake pool, the way that you may be "banned" from centralized social media platforms. You only retire a stake pool if and whenever you want.</p>

      <p>Like a bank, the size of every Cardano stake pool is fluid. Over time, the number of community members who use any particular stake pool tends to rise and fall. The Cardano protocol slightly incentivizes community members who delegate stake to a pool to continue helping grow the pool, for example by staking returns. The protocol also ensures that every stake in the Cardano ecosystem receives a fair rate of return.</p>

      <p>Observing the practices of other stake pools in the Cardano ecosystem may be a beneficial learning experience. However, comparing a stake pool that you operate to other pools generally is not helpful. For example, while pools having larger stakes are responsible for producing more blocks, pools having smaller stakes may be able to adapt better to changing market conditions. As a stake pool operator, you gain unique, individual insight and perspective within the Cardano ecosystem as well as the society where you may live, giving you a valuable and important voice as your experience grows. As your skills and knowledge improve, you become more able to contribute in ways that interest you. Operating a stake pool presents an opportunity to manifest your vision in the world through coordination, collaboration and cooperation with passionate others who may share your beliefs.</p>

      <p>Cardano's strength lies in diversity. Regardless of stake size, every stake pool plays an important role in creating a healthy business environment by helping decentralize and offering choice for consumers in the Cardano ecosystem. Operating a stake pool involves an element of delivering customer service. Being useful to society matters—your careful hard work, dedication and patience building a better world also strengthen the Cardano ecosystem.</p>

      <p>Only invest an amount that you can afford to lose in cryptocurrency projects. Manage your expectations. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Understanding your tolerance for risk before investing is very important so that you can make suitable and educated investment decisions, including decisions related to operating a stake pool. Keep your approach sustainable and balanced. For example, diversify your investments. Always follow local laws and regulations.</p>

      <p>Securing the network is only the beginning!</p>
