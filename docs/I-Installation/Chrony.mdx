To operate as part of the Cardano network and produce blocks successfully, the system clock on computers running Cardano Node must be accurate.

[Chrony](https://chrony-project.org/)—an implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP)—synchronizes the system clock on a computer with NTP servers.

Set up Chrony on all computers in your stake pool configuration.

**To install Chrony:**

1\. Using a terminal window, type:
```
sudo apt-get install chrony
```

2\. To configure Chrony, type:
```
sudo nano /etc/chrony/chrony.conf
```

3\. In the `chrony.conf` file, add or edit the following lines, and then save and close the file:
```
# Comment out default sources
#pool ntp.ubuntu.com        iburst maxsources 4
#pool 0.ubuntu.pool.ntp.org iburst maxsources 1
#pool 1.ubuntu.pool.ntp.org iburst maxsources 1
#pool 2.ubuntu.pool.ntp.org iburst maxsources 2

# Add up to 3 sources from each of the following pools, polling every 64 to 1024 seconds
# and ignoring round trips longer than 3 seconds
pool time.google.com iburst minpoll 6 maxpoll 10 maxdelay 3 maxsources 3
pool ntp.ubuntu.com  iburst minpoll 6 maxpoll 10 maxdelay 3 maxsources 3
pool us.pool.ntp.org iburst minpoll 6 maxpoll 10 maxdelay 3 maxsources 3

# Stop bad estimates upsetting machine clock
maxupdateskew 5.0

# Step the system clock instead of slewing if the adjustment is larger than 0.1 seconds
makestep 0.1 -1
```

:::note
For details on directives in the `chrony.conf` file, see the [manual page](https://chrony-project.org/doc/3.4/chrony.conf.html).
:::

4\. To restart Chrony, type:
```
sudo systemctl restart chronyd.service
```

5\. Repeat the procedure on each computer in your stake pool configuration.
