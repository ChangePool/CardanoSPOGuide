       <p>Cardano is a decentralized, public blockchain platform and cryptocurrency project aiming to provide a secure and scalable infrastructure for the development of decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts. A focus on sustainability, security, interoperability and a research-driven approach to development differentiate Cardano. The native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transactions as well as staking, enabling users to earn a return on investments and participate in the governance of the ecosystem.</p>

      <p>Every Cardano stake pool requires one node configured as a block producer. To preserve network security, stake pools operating on Mainnet also implement one or more relay nodes, as illustrated in <i>Figure 1</i>.</p>
