The `root` account is the superuser account having unlimited administrative privileges to manage your computer. In Ubuntu 22.04, the `root` account is disabled by default.

Disabling the `root` account improves security because the known `root` username provides attackers a potential opportunity to crack a single password in order to gain full access to your computer. Disabling the `root` account also protects you from consquences of mistakes that you may make. For example, running an `rm` command accidentally as the `root` user may delete all files on your computer.

**To disable the `root` account:**

1. Using a terminal window, type `sudo passwd -l root` to lock the password for the `root` user.

:::note
If you need to enable the `root` account, type `sudo passwd -u root` to unlock the password for the `root` user.
