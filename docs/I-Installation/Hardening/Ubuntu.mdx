The *How to Set Up a Cardano Stake Pool* guide assumes that you run the Cardano Node software application on computers using [Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Desktop](https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/).

:::note
For full details on supported operating systems for Cardano Node, see the [release notes](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/releases) for the latest version.
:::

**To install Ubuntu Desktop:**

1\. Follow the [Install Ubuntu Desktop](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop) tutorial.

2\. In the **Create Your Account** dialog, type `cardano` in the **Your Username** field. Complete the other fields in the dialog, and then click **Next**

3\. Complete the tutorial.

Alternately, if you plan to install Cardano Node using an existing Ubuntu Desktop installation, then create the `cardano` standard account using the command line.

**To create a standard account using the command line:**

1\. Using a terminal window, type:
```
# Create a new user named cardano
useradd -m -s /bin/bash cardano
# Set the password for the cardano user
passwd cardano
# Add the cardano user to the sudo group
usermod -aG sudo cardano
```

The hash character (#) indicates that the remainder of the line is a comment.
:::

Throughout the *How to Set Up a Cardano Stake Pool* guide, log in to a computer hosting Cardano Node using the `cardano` standard account. To perform administrative tasks, use the `sudo` or `su` command.

:::tip
For information on using `sudo` and `su` commands, see [Exploring the Differences between sudo and su Commands in Linux](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/difference-between-sudo-su) for example.

Setting a static IP address provides reliable remote access to the services operating on a computer, such as Secure Shell and Cardano Node.

**To configure a static IP address:**

1\. Follow the [Static IP Configuration](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-configure-static-ip-address-on-ubuntu-18-10-cosmic-cuttlefish-linux) tutorial.
