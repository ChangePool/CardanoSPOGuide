[Fail2ban](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban) is an open-source software that protects servers from intrusion by monitoring log files for suspicious activities, such as brute-force login attempts, and automatically banning offending IP addresses using firewall rules.

**To install fail2ban:**

1\. Using a terminal window, type:
```bash
sudo apt-get install fail2ban
```

2\. To configure fail2ban, type:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```

3\. At the end of the `jail.local` file, add the following lines where `<PortNumber>` is the port number where SSH Server listens on the local computer, and `<Whitelist>` is a `SPACE`- and/or `COMMA`-separated list of IP addresses, CIDR masks or DNS host names that fail2ban does NOT ban:
```bash
[sshd]
enabled = true
port = <PortNumber>
filter = sshd
logpath = /var/log/auth.log
maxretry = 3
# whitelisted IP addresses
ignoreip = <Whitelist>
```

:::tip
Add the static IP address of the computer that you use to administer your Cardano stake pool to `<Whitelist>` For more details, see an example [`jail.conf`](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban/blob/master/config/jail.conf) file.
:::

4\. Save and close the `jail.local` file.

5\. To restart fail2ban, type:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
```
