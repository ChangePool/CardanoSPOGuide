        #### Upgrading Release Dependencies

        **CNCLI**

        If you use CNCLI for leaderlogs and sendslots, then you must upgrade to `cncli version 4.0.1`

        ```bash

        RELEASETAG=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/AndrewWestberg/cncli/releases/latest | jq -r .tag_name)
        VERSION=$(echo ${RELEASETAG} | cut -c 2-)
        echo "Installing release ${RELEASETAG}"
        curl -sLJ https://github.com/AndrewWestberg/cncli/releases/download/${RELEASETAG}/cncli-${VERSION}-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz -o /tmp/cncli-${VERSION}-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
        ```

        ```bash
        sudo tar xzvf /tmp/cncli-${VERSION}-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin/
        ```

        To confirm that the new version of CNCLI is installed, type:

        ```
        cncli -V
        ```

        It should return the updated version number.

        **gLiveView**

        ```bash
        cd ${NODE_HOME}
        curl -s -o gLiveView.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/master/scripts/cnode-helper-scripts/gLiveView.sh
        curl -s -o env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/master/scripts/cnode-helper-scripts/env
        chmod 755 gLiveView.sh
        # Update env file with the stake pools configuration.
        sed -i env \
            -e "s/\#CONFIG=\"\${CNODE_HOME}\/files\/config.json\"/CONFIG=\"\${NODE_HOME}\/mainnet-config.json\"/g" \
            -e "s/\#SOCKET=\"\${CNODE_HOME}\/sockets\/node0.socket\"/SOCKET=\"\${NODE_HOME}\/db\/socket\"/g"
        ```

    <TabItem value="v1.29.0 Notes" label="v1.29.0 Notes">

        **Full release notes:** [**https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases/tag/1.29.0**](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases/tag/1.29.0)

        This release is an important update to the node that provides the functionality that is needed following the Alonzo hard fork.\
        **All users, including stake pool operators, must upgrade to this version (or a later version) of the node.**

        The release includes features that will enable the use of the node in the Alonzo era, allowing the on-chain execution of Plutus scripts,\
        including extended CLI commands to support the construction of transactions that include Plutus scripts, datums and redeemers.\
        It incorporates several improvements, including a new `transaction build` command that calculates transaction fees and Plutus script execution units, and a new version of the `query tip` command that provides additional information, including node synchronisation progress. The `transaction build` command requires a local instance of the node in order to check Plutus script validity and to provide information that is used by the fee calculation. The Shelley specification has also been updated with respect to rewards calculation.

        Note that this release changes the log format of traces configured by `TraceChainSyncHeaderServer` and `TraceChainSyncClient` . See [#2746](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/pull/2746) for more detail.

        #### Release Dependencies

        **1. If using cncli for leaderlogs and sendslots, update to `cncli version 3.15` is required.**

        ```bash
        RELEASETAG=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/AndrewWestberg/cncli/releases/latest | jq -r .tag_name)
        VERSION=$(echo ${RELEASETAG} | cut -c 2-)
        echo "Installing release ${RELEASETAG}"
        curl -sLJ https://github.com/AndrewWestberg/cncli/releases/download/${RELEASETAG}/cncli-${VERSION}-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz -o /tmp/cncli-${VERSION}-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
        ```

        ```bash
        sudo tar xzvf /tmp/cncli-${VERSION}-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin/
        ```

        **Checking that cncli is properly updated**

        ```
        cncli -V
        ```

        It should return the updated version number.

        **2. Download `mainnet-alonzo-genesis.json` file**

        ```bash
        cd $NODE_HOME
        wget -N https://hydra.iohk.io/build/7416228/download/1/mainnet-alonzo-genesis.json
        ```

        **3. Download new`mainnet-config.json` file to with alonzo configurations.**

        :::info
        If you have any custom mainnet configurations, be sure to backup and re-apply your settings.
        :::

        ```bash
        cd $NODE_HOME
        wget -N https://hydra.iohk.io/build/7416228/download/1/mainnet-config.json
        sed -i mainnet-config.json \
            -e "s/TraceBlockFetchDecisions\": false/TraceBlockFetchDecisions\": true/g" \
            -e "s/127.0.0.1/0.0.0.0/g"
        ```

        Verify that your **mainnet-config.json** contains the following two new lines.

        ```
        "AlonzoGenesisFile": "mainnet-alonzo-genesis.json",
        "AlonzoGenesisHash": "7e94a15f55d1e82d10f09203fa1d40f8eede58fd8066542cf6566008068ed874",
        ```

        View your **mainnet-config.json**

        ```bash
        cat mainnet-config.json
        ```

        Example of what it should look like with the two new lines.

        ```bash
        {
            "AlonzoGenesisFile": "mainnet-alonzo-genesis.json",
            "AlonzoGenesisHash": "7e94a15f55d1e82d10f09203fa1d40f8eede58fd8066542cf6566008068ed874",
            "ApplicationName": "cardano-sl",
            "ApplicationVersion": 1,
            "ByronGenesisFile": "byron-genesis.json",
            "ByronGenesisHash": "5f20df933584822601f9e3f8c024eb5eb252fe8cefb24d1317dc3d432e940ebb",

            "LastKnownBlockVersion-Major": 3,
            "LastKnownBlockVersion-Minor": 0,
            "MaxKnownMajorProtocolVersion": 2,
            "Protocol": "Cardano",
            "RequiresNetworkMagic": "RequiresNoMagic",
            "ShelleyGenesisFile": "genesis.json",
            "ShelleyGenesisHash": "1a3be38bcbb7911969283716ad7aa550250226b76a61fc51cc9a9a35d9276d81",
        ```

        4. If case your node does not start up properly, refresh `mainnet-shelley-genesis.json`

        ```bash
        cd $NODE_HOME
        wget -N https://hydra.iohk.io/build/7416228/download/1/mainnet-shelley-genesis.json
        ```
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="v1.27.0 Notes" label="v1.27.0 Notes">

        **Full release notes:** [**https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases/tag/1.27.0**](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases/tag/1.27.0)

        Node version 1.27.0 provides important new functionality, including supporting new CLI commands that have been requested by stake pools, providing garbage collection metrics.\
        It includes the performance fixes for the epoch boundary calculation that were released in node version [1.26.2](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases/tag/1.26.2), plus a number of bug fixes and code improvements.\
        It also includes many fundamental changes that are needed to prepare for forthcoming feature releases (notably Plutus scripts in the Alonzo era).\
        Note that this release includes breaking changes to the API and CLI commands, and that compilation using GHC version 8.6.5 is no longer supported.

        #### Release Dependencies

        **1. If using cncli for leaderlogs and sendslots, update to `cncli version 2.10` is required.**

        ```bash
        RELEASETAG=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/AndrewWestberg/cncli/releases/latest | jq -r .tag_name)
        VERSION=$(echo ${RELEASETAG} | cut -c 2-)
        echo "Installing release ${RELEASETAG}"
        curl -sLJ https://github.com/AndrewWestberg/cncli/releases/download/${RELEASETAG}/cncli-${VERSION}-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz -o /tmp/cncli-${VERSION}-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
        ```

        ```bash
        sudo tar xzvf /tmp/cncli-${VERSION}-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin/
        ```

        **Checking that cncli is properly updated**

        ```
        cncli -V
        ```

        It should return the updated version number.

        This point release is a recommended upgrade for all stake pool operators. It is not required for relays or other passive nodes. It ensures that block producing nodes do not unnecessarily re-evaluate the stake distribution at the epoch boundary.

        :::info
        It is possible to upgrade from v1.25.1 but for a smooth update, ensure you have completed the v1.26.1 release dependencies, notably the ghc and cabal updates. Also note the database migration can take up to 2 hours.

### Compiling the New Binaries

To update with `$HOME/git/cardano-node` as the current binaries directory, clone a new git repo named `cardano-node2` so that you have a backup in case of rollback. Remove the old binaries.

```bash
cd $HOME/git
rm -rf cardano-node-old/
git clone https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node.git cardano-node2
cd cardano-node2/
```

Run the following command to pull and build the latest binaries. Change the checkout **tag** or **branch** as needed.

```bash
cd $HOME/git/cardano-node2
cabal update
git fetch --all --recurse-submodules --tags
git checkout $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases/latest | jq -r .tag_name)
cabal configure -O0 -w ghc-8.10.4
cabal build all
cabal build cardano-cli
```
<!-- Source: https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node-wiki/blob/main/docs/getting-started/install.md -->

:::info
Build process may take a few minutes up to a few hours depending on your computer's processing power.
:::

Verify your **cardano-cli** and **cardano-node** were updated to the expected version.

```bash
$(find $HOME/git/cardano-node2/dist-newstyle/build -type f -name "cardano-cli") version
$(find $HOME/git/cardano-node2/dist-newstyle/build -type f -name "cardano-node") version
```

Copy **cardano-cli** and **cardano-node** files into bin directory.

```bash
sudo cp $(find $HOME/git/cardano-node2/dist-newstyle/build -type f -name "cardano-cli") /usr/local/bin/cardano-cli
```

```bash
sudo cp $(find $HOME/git/cardano-node2/dist-newstyle/build -type f -name "cardano-node") /usr/local/bin/cardano-node
```

Verify your **cardano-cli** and **cardano-node** were copied successfully and updated to the expected version.

```bash
cardano-node version
cardano-cli version
```

:::info
**Optional Best Practice**: Now is an opportune time to update/upgrade and reboot your Ubuntu operating system.

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y && sudo reboot
```
:::

:::tip
Now restart your node to use the updated binaries. If you used the previously mentioned optional best practice, your binaries should've already auto-started.

## Troubleshooting

### :motorway: Forked off

Forget to update your node and now your node is stuck on an old chain?

Reset your database files and be sure to grab the [latest genesis, config, topology json files](https://book.play.dev.cardano.org/environments.html).

```bash
cd $NODE_HOME
rm -rf db
```
