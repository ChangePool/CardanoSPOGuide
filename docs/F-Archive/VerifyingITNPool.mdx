In order to defend against spoofing and hijacking of reputable stake pools, as a stake pool operator you can verify the ticker of the stake pool that you operate by proving ownership of an Incentivized Testnet (ITN) stake pool.

:::info
The ITN phase of the Cardano Shelley era ran from late November 2019 to late June 2020. If you participated, then you can verify a ticker.
:::

On the air-gapped, offline computer, ensure that the [jcli](https://github.com/input-output-hk/jormungandr/releases/tag/v0.8.14) binaries are present in the `$NODE_HOME` folder.

**To sign the stake pool id, type the following command using a terminal window:**
```bash
./jcli key sign --secret-key itn_owner.skey stakepoolid.txt --output stakepoolid.sig
```

Visit [Cardano PoolTool](https://pooltool.io) and enter your owner public key and pool id witness data in the metadata section.

To find your pool id witness, type the following command using a terminal window on the air-gapped, offline computer:
```bash
cat stakepoolid.sig
```

Find your owner public key in the file you generated on ITN. This data might be stored in a file having the file name extension `.pub`

Finally, [Update the Stake Pool Registration Certificate](/UpdatingPoolRegCert) using the PoolTool-generated `metadata-url` and `metadata-hash` Notice that the metadata has an `extended` key-value pair.
