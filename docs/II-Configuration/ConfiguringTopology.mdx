Network topology describes the physical and logical structure of a network. In the Cardano Mainnet network, for security reasons each stake pool must operate at least one block-producing node and one relay node. The keys and certificates required to issue blocks are located on the block-producing node. Your block producer must connect **only** to one or more relay nodes that you—the stake pool operator—control.

For an illustration, see the <a href="/GettingStarted#topology">Cardano Network Topology</a> diagram.

For details on Cardano networking components, visit [Peer-to-peer (P2P) Networking](https://docs.cardano.org/explore-cardano/cardano-network/p2p-networking/).

Before you start the nodes comprising your stake pool, you must:

* Configure your relay node(s) to connect with your block-producing node
* Configure your block-producing node to connect only with your relay node(s)

## Configuring a Relay Node

**To configure your relay node(s) to connect with your block-producing node:**

1\. On the computer hosting your relay node, in a terminal window type the following command to navigate to the folder where you downloaded Cardano configuration files:
```bash
cd ${NODE_HOME}
```

2\. Using a text editor, open the `config.json` file, and then edit the following option if needed:
```bash
"EnableP2P": true,
```

3\. Save and close the `config.json` file.

4\. To create a backup of the original topology configuration file, type:

```bash
cp topology.json topology.json.bak
```

5\. Using a text editor, open the `topology.json` file, and then add a record for the block-producing node in the `localRoots` section as follows, where `<BlockProducingNodeIPAddress>` is the IP address of the block-producing node in your stake pool configuration, and `<BlockProducingNodeName>` is an optional descriptive label for your block-producing node. Also, set the value `true` for the `trustable` key:

```bash
{
  "bootstrapPeers": [
    {
      "address": "backbone.cardano.iog.io",
      "port": 3001
    },
    {
      "address": "backbone.mainnet.emurgornd.com",
      "port": 3001
    },
    {
      "address": "backbone.mainnet.cardanofoundation.org",
      "port": 3001
    }
  ],
  "localRoots": [
    {
      "accessPoints": [
        {
          "address": "<BlockProducingNodeIPAddress>",
          "port": 6000,
          "name": "<BlockProducingNodeName>"
        }
      ],
      "advertise": false,
      "comment": "Do NOT advertise the block-producing node",
      "trustable": true,
      "valency": 1
    }
  ],
  "publicRoots": [
    {
      "accessPoints": [],
      "advertise": false
    }
  ],
  "useLedgerAfterSlot": 157852837
}
```

:::info
To follow best practices, set `<BlockProducingNodeIPAddress>` to the local area network (LAN) Internet protocol (IP) address of the computer hosting the block-producing node when possible. If necessary—for example, if you set up your block-producing node on a different network than the relay node—then use the wide area network (WAN) IP address.
:::

:::info
 Connecting to `backbone.cardano.iog.io`, `backbone.mainnet.emurgornd.com` and `backbone.mainnet.cardanofoundation.org` in the `bootstrapPeers` section of the `topology.json` file allows your relay node to synchronize a local copy of the Cardano blockchain ledger with the network.

    <tr>
      <td class="boxLabel"><p class="boxLabel">Challenge<br /><img src="img/BoxChallenge.png" alt="Challenge" /></p></td>
      <td class="boxText"><p class="boxText">When synchronizing the local copy of the Cardano blockchain ledger with the network, the `useLedgerAfterSlot` option determines when the Cardano Node instance switches from using fixed peers to discovering peers registered on the blockchain. As the Cardano ledger grows, the recommended value of `useLedgerAfterSlot` changes. Every few months, update the value of the `useLedgerAfterSlot` option in your configuration files based on the value recommended in the respective configuration file available on the <a href="https://book.play.dev.cardano.org/environments.html" target="_blank">Environments</a> page.</p></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

6\. Save and close the `topology.json` file.

7\. To configure additional relay nodes, repeat steps 1 to 6 for each additional relay node in your stake pool configuration.

## Configuring Your Block-producing Node

**To configure your block-producing node to connect only with your relay node(s):**

1\. On the computer hosting your block-producing node, in a terminal window type the following command to navigate to the folder where you downloaded Cardano configuration files:
```bash
cd ${NODE_HOME}
```

2\. Using a text editor, open the `config-bp.json` file, and then edit the following option if needed:
```bash
"EnableP2P": true,
```

3\. Save and close the `config-bp.json` file.

4\. To create a backup of the original topology configuration file, type:
```bash
cp topology.json topology.json.bak
```

5\. Using a text editor, open the `topology.json` file, and then replace the contents of the file with one or more records, as needed, to reference only the relay node(s) in your stake pool configuration. For example, the following lines configure a single relay node where `<RelayNodeIPAddress>` is the IP address of the relay node and `<RelayNodeName>` is an optional descriptive label for the relay node. Set the value `true` for the `trustable` key. Also, set the value of `bootstrapPeers` to `null` and the value of `useLedgerAfterSlot` to `-1`:
```bash
{
  "bootstrapPeers": null,
  "localRoots": [
    {
      "accessPoints": [
	    {
          "address": "<RelayNodeIPAddress>",
          "port": 6000,
          "name": "<RelayNodeName>"
        }
	  ],
      "advertise": false,
      "trustable": true,
      "valency": 1
    }
  ],
  "publicRoots": [
    {
      "accessPoints": [],
      "advertise": false
    }
  ],
  "useLedgerAfterSlot": -1
}
```

:::info
To follow best practices, set `<RelayNodeIPAddress>` to the LAN IP address of the computer hosting the relay node when possible. If necessary—for example, if you set up a relay node on a different network than the block-producing node—then use the WAN IP address. If you configure multiple relay nodes in the `localRoots` section, then set the `valency` key to match the number of relay nodes.

<table class="box">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="boxLabel"><p class="boxLabel">Important<br /><img src="img/BoxImportant.png" alt="Important" /></p></td>
      <td class="boxText"><p class="boxText">Setting `useLedgerAfterSlot` to the value `-1` disables discovering peers registered on the blockchain. Connect your block producer **only** to one or more relay nodes that you as the stake pool operator control.</p></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

6\. Save and close the `topology.json` file.

## Configuring Port Forwarding

Port forwarding creates an association between the public WAN IP address of a router and a private LAN IP address dedicated to a computer or device on the private network that the router manages.

So that relay nodes in the Cardano network can connect to a relay node in your stake pool configuration, in your firewall configuration you must open a port and forward traffic received on the port to the computer and port where the relay node listens.

:::info
In the procedures to configure topology above, all block-producing and relay nodes in the stake pool configuration listen on port 6000 If you followed CoinCashew instructions for [Maintaining a Firewall](/Hardening/Firewall), then also ensure that in `ufw` you allow incoming traffic on the port where the Cardano Node on the local computer listens, as needed.
:::

To help confirm that your ports are configured as needed, you can use [you get signal](https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/) or [CanYouSeeMe.org](https://canyouseeme.org/) for example.

## Conclusion

The topology configuration described above allows your nodes to connect securely with each other, as well as with other relay nodes in the Cardano network.

If you configure two or more relays in your stake pool, then consider [Enabling Peer Sharing](/PeerSharing) to help improve network security.
